FP16 Demotion Plugin - Memory Usage Analysis
==========================================

VARIABLES:
  Total float variables found: 5
  Successfully demoted: 3
  Demotion success rate: 60.0%

LITERALS:
  Total float literals found: 5
  Successfully demoted: 3
  Demotion success rate: 60.0%

MEMORY USAGE:
  Original memory usage: 40 bytes
  After demotion: 28 bytes
  Memory saved: 12 bytes
  Memory reduction: 30.0%

BREAKDOWN:
  Float (4 bytes each): 10 items
  __fp16 (2 bytes each): 6 items
  Remaining float: 4 items

EXPLANATION:
- Each 'float' uses 4 bytes of memory
- Each '__fp16' uses 2 bytes of memory
- Successful demotion saves 2 bytes per item
- Unsafe items remain as float (4 bytes) for correctness
